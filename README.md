# exercicio_pokemon_battle
Web platform that simulates battles between pokemons through a points system, that is, as soon as the pokemons are selected on the web page and the "battle" button is pressed, the result is displayed, informing which pokemon won or if there is a tie.

The platform was developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript, and the 'points' of each pokemon were extracted from this website: https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/all

This app works primarily through a select list that is made through a loop that goes through the array of objects that are pokemons. By choosing the items from this list, a comparison is made between the "points" of the pokemons and choosing the winner.
Regarding the display, when the "battle" button is clicked, the two chosen pokemons are displayed and just below the winner or the result of a draw is displayed.

Additionally, there is a "clear" button that clears the select tags and variables in the Javascript file. And after the information displayed there is a "back" button that returns the application to its original state and clears the inputs and variables.

To date, no problems have been detected when executing the code.
